    A preset is a set of predefined values,
    To maipulate it, a file is generated

    To set them is a multi stage procedure:
    - generate a new base site description using:
        bin/s --add-site NEW_SITE_NAME

        This will generate a file:
            sites_list/global_sites/NEW_SITE_NAME
    - in the site-description uncomment the odoo main modules that should be installed
    - prepare setting the preset values:
        bin/s --prepare-site NEW_SITE_NAME
            sites_list/global_sites_preset/NEW_SITE_NAME
                this files contains a block of values per included odoo module
                each value should be set to a sensible value.
                These Blocks are collected from skeleton/preset/ERP_MAIN_MODULE

                to edit these values execute the following command:
                    bin/ee  NEW_SITE_NAME
