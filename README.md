# erp-workbench
an environment to create odoo sites

Preparation:
------------
```
    # python-tk tcl8.6-dev tk8.6-dev
    # have postgres up and running
    sudo apt install -y postgresql postgresql-contrib

    #add yourself as postgres superuser to the database:
    sudo -u postgres psql -e --command "CREATE USER $USER WITH SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'admin'"

    # install os libraries
        sudo apt-get -y install build-essential libfreetype6-dev libjpeg8-dev liblcms2-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev \
        libtiff5-dev libwebp-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev node-less postgresql-server-dev* python-dev python3-dev python3-pip \
        zlib1g-dev postgresql-client python-virtualenv git vim npm nodejs libmysqlclient-dev \
        curl node-gyp

    # install the virtualenv wrapper 
    # (see http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html):
        sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper
```

add the following lines to .bashrc by executing 
```
    echo "# ------------------ start workon stuff -------------------
    export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
    export PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/projetcs
    source $(which virtualenvwrapper.sh)" >> $HOME/.bashrc
    
```
take care that the last line (source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh) is correct.
It could be, that virtualenvwrapper.sh was installed to a different directory.

important:
make sure, that afther opening a new shell the following two conditions are met:
- no message after opening the shell like:
    /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh not found
- the command:
    which virtualenvwrapper.sh
    produces a valid result

clone the erp-workbench repo
----------------------------
```
git clone https://github.com/robertrottermann/erp-workbench.git
cd erp-workbench/
```

create a virtualenv for erp-workbench
-------------------------------------
make sure you are in the folder into which you git cloned erp-workbench!

execute the following commands in a NEW bash window:
```
    # create virtualenv for erp-workbench
    mkvirtualenv -a . -p python3 workbench
    # for convinience crete the following two links
    (cd bin; ln -s $(which python))
    (cd bin; ln -s $(which pip))
    # install all required python libraries
    bin/pip install -r install/requirements.txt
    # generate the help files
    (cd help; make html)
    # generate an alias to easily start the workbench
    (echo $'\n''alias  wb="workon workbench"' >> ~/.bash_aliases)
    # open the help files
    bin/help
```
After having executed the above commands and opened a new bash terminal
(you created a new alias, that is only active when loaded while opening a terminal)

the command:

`   wb`

will activate the workbench environment and cd into its main folder!

list existing site descriptions to force creation of config files
-----------------------------------------------------------------
```
wb # to start/set  erp-workbench
bin/c -ls   # list exising site descriptions
```
The following message will be displayed::

    --------------------------------------------------
    The structure of the config files have changed.
    please check /home/robert/erp-workbench/config/project.yaml if everything ist correct.
    --------------------------------------------------
and the command will terminate.
This is because no configuration files have existed yet, but have
been constructed for you.
You have to restart your the command bin/ls. It will then use the freshly created environment.

As a side effect, two new site descriptions have been created, and can be listed by repeating the above command:
```
bin/c -ls   # list exising site descriptions
```
now the two new site-descriptions are listed::
    demo_global
    demo_local (local)

To inspect them you can load any of them in the default editor, which is "code", by executing:
```
bin/e demo_global
```

If want to use an oder editor than VS code or if it is not installed, you can adapt what editor to use in::
    
    config/config.yaml

On of the first elements you have to adapt, is to tell erp-workbench, in what repository to save the site-descriptions.
By default is done using localhost and without git.
Please generate and read the documentation on how to change it.


## step by step in a freshly installed ubuntu 18.04

as user root:
the package terminator is not strictly necessary but very convenient for shell junkies like me :)
It migth be possible, that the following list of libraries must be adapted to the linux versions.

```
        sudo apt install -y terminator postgresql postgresql-contrib \
            build-essential libfreetype6-dev libjpeg8-dev liblcms2-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev  libssl1.0-dev libffi-dev \
            libtiff5-dev libwebp-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev node-less postgresql-server-dev* python-dev python3-dev \
            python-tk tcl8.6-dev tk8.6-dev zlib1g-dev postgresql-client python-virtualenv git vim npm nodejs libmysqlclient-dev \
            curl node-gyp python-pip python3-sphinx
```

als normal user:
### install and configure virtualenvwrapper

```
sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper
```
```
echo "
    # ------------------ start workon stuff -------------------
    export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
    export PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/projetcs
    source $(which virtualenvwrapper.sh)
    " >> $HOME/.bashrc

```
test if this worked. 
```
workon
```
this should not provide any output at all

### clone erp-workbench

```
git clone https://github.com/robertrottermann/erp-workbench.git
```

### setup virtualenv an alias for erp-workbench

**IMPORTANT!** the following commands have to be executed in a **NEW** bash shell

```
    cd $HOME/erp-workbench
    # create virtualenv for erp-workbench
    mkvirtualenv -a . -p python3 workbench
    # for convinience crete the following two links
    (cd bin; ln -s $(which python))
    (cd bin; ln -s $(which pip))
    # install all required python libraries
    bin/pip install -r install/requirements.txt
    # generate the help files
    (cd help; make html)
    # generate an alias to easily start the workbench
    (echo $'\n''alias  wb="workon workbench"' >> ~/.bash_aliases)
    # open the help files
    bin/help
```

**BRAVO** you have installed erp-workbench, now lets configure it!

In an **NEW** bash-shell (*always when you alter the environment, the changes will only be active in a new window*) you can execute the command:
```
wb
```
this will activate the erp-workbench environment, and change to its main folder.




## Troubleshooting
### error running command wb

When after executing the command wb you get the message:
```
robert@lappi:~$ wb
ERROR: Environment 'workbench' does not exist. Create it with 'mkvirtualenv workbench'.
```

execute the following commands:

```
    cd $HOME/erp-workbench
    mkvirtualenv -a . -p python3 workbench
```

### command bin/help does not work

### could not import sites list
When executing a commmand like bin/c -ls
pruducing an error like
```
********************************************************************************
could not import sites list
```
then the easiest "solution" is to just remove the folder sites_list

```
rm -r sites_list/
# and then let erp-workbench recreate them
bin/c -ls
```
