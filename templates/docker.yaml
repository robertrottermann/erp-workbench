# DOCKER_DEFAULTS provides the information needed to work with docker

    # dumper_image:
    # when dumping a container based erp site site to its backup structure
    # a docker container is used that has access to databse container

    # to create a this dumper container we need an image which uses pgdump
    # to dump the db.
    # since pgdump is database version dependent, the database container
    # and the dumper container need to use the same pgdump version.
